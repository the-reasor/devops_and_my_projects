# Since I am covering how to install docker on another guide I will not cover it here.

mkdir octoprint_multicam
cd octoprint_multicam
git clone https://github.com/the-reasor/devops/blob/main/docker_projects/octoprint/octoprint_multicam.yml

docker-compose -f octoprint_cam.yml up -d

# You should now see docker fetch and configure the containers, once that is done navigate to the IP of the docker host at port 4000
# http://your-octoprint-host-IP-here:4000
# Make sure it is on http, not https.
# Now follow the instructions on screen to set up octoprint, you may want to set up the default webcam here.
# http://your-octoprint-host-IP-here:8080/?action=stream

# After that it requires some extra work to enable both webcams in the octoprint UI.
# All that is needed is to install the multicam plugin for octoprint by going to:
# Settings > plugins manager > more plugins > multicam > install
# Then restart octoprint through the WebUI.

# After this configure it through:
# Settings > multicam
# click the plus button then fill in the first field of each cam as follows.

# http://your-octoprint-host-IP-here:8080/?action=stream
# http://your-octoprint-host-IP-here:8090/?action=stream
