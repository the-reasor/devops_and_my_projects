# Fortune was broken on debian 12 and only ever put out qoutes in italian so here is what I did to fix it.

# Remove the packages
rm -rf /usr/share/games/fortunes/
sudo apt purge "fortune"
sudo apt remove fortunes
sudo apt remove fortune-mod

# Reinstall
sudo apt install fortune

# Test that it installed
fortune

# It needs a list of fortunes
sudo apt install fortunes

# Lets make things colorful
sudo apt install lolcat


fortune | cowsay -f dragon | lolcat

# That was fun, lets make it happen every time anyone logs in, or if you want it just for yourself scroll to the next section.

# The etc/bash.bashrc is for all users on the system.
sudo nano /etc/bash.bashrc

# Add the folowing to the very end of the file
fortune | cowsay -f dragon | lolcat

# Now save and exit, ctrl+s then ctrl+x

#==============================================

# If you want the greeter just for you then edit the folowing file:
sudo nano ~/.bashrc

# Add the folowing to the very end of the file
fortune | cowsay -f dragon | lolcat

# Now save and exit, ctrl+s then ctrl+x
