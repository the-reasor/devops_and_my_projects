# Here I will detail how to install Home Assistant (HA) on Debian12 in supervised mode.
# The reasons for doing this are that it allows me access to the host system and allows use of docker while still retaining the ability to use HA plugins.
# Additionally I will make another guide on how to install HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)

# First step is to install debian 12. I would reccomend using the live image rather than the network installer.


# Enough preface, lets start things off. 
# Assuming you have successfully installed Debian 12 run these commands

sudo -i

apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y

apt --fix-broken install

apt install apparmor jq wget curl udisks2 libglib2.0-bin network-manager dbus lsb-release systemd-journal-remote systemd-resolved -y

curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sh

# This will install Docker and the dependencies for the OS Agent and the Supervised installer.
# Next we need to install the OS Agent for the correct archetecture. I am using a 64 bit OS so I will use the os-agent_1.6.0_linux_x86_64.deb

# Change directories to src and download the OS Agent deb file.
cd /usr/local/src
wget https://github.com/home-assistant/os-agent/releases/download/1.6.0/os-agent_1.6.0_linux_x86_64.deb

# Now install it with dpkg -i
dpkg -i os-agent_1.6.0_linux_x86_64.deb

# If you have issues you may have to install udisks2
apt install udisks2 -y

# If that fails run this:
apt --fix-broken install

# After that udisks2 should have been installed automatically while it was fixing broken installs.
# You can check just to be sure.
apt install udisks2 -y

# That should return 0 new installed in the install report.

# Next we install HA Supervised.

wget https://github.com/home-assistant/supervised-installer/releases/latest/download/homeassistant-supervised.deb

dpkg -i homeassistant-supervised.deb


# This might fail with certain packages not installed. Lets install them with the following and try again.
# The install script for Docker may have also failed so lets run that again:

curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sh

# You may need to fix broken again then try the script again

apt --fix-broken install
curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sh

apt install docker-ce network-manager jq systemd-journal-remote systemd-resolved

# And of course the dependencies for HA break networking too so lets spend our precious time fixing that as well.
# If you have issues with apt not reaching debian servers to pull packages you may be able to fix it with my guide, located here:
