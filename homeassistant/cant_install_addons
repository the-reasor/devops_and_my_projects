# If you cannot install addons and are given this error:
# 'AddonManager.install' blocked from execution, system is not healthy - privileged
# This is how to fix it.

# First check the error and the guide given by them “Settings > System > Repairs > kebab (3 dots) > System Information”
# It should provide a link if you click "Learn more" and that should give you information about fixing the problem.

# For me it said "home assistant does not have privileged access to the docker runtime. Use the link to learn more and how to fix this."
# Unfortunately it didnt tell me anything about how to fix it so I had to find my own solution.
sudo systemctl restart hassio-supervisor.service


# After that I had another issue
# "System is unsupported because the wrong version of Docker CGroup is in use. Use the link to learn the correct version and how to fix this."
# https://www.home-assistant.io/more-info/unsupported/cgroup_version
# Following the guide I decided the best way to handle this was to rerun the supervised installer
sudo -i
cd /usr/local/src
dpkg -i homeassistant-supervised.deb
