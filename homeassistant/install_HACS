# It is recomended to use the ssh addon for HA to install this. Why? No freaking clue but it broke when I tried to use normal ssh last time.

# Settings > Addons > addon store > search 'ssh' > click the top one > install 
# NOTE: it should bring you to a page with the OpenBSD pufferfish behind the "OpenSSH" text. If not then its the wrong addon.

# Now enable all the slider toggles and then navigate to the terminal and enter this:

wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hacs/get/main/get | bash -

# Now reboot.
