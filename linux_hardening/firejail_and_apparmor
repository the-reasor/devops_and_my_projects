#Here I will explain how to install and configure firejail and apparmor on a fresh install of Ubuntu.
#Doing this will result in a fairly secure system and this is what is implemented in professional tools like Parrot Security OS.
# I dont think there is a entry on firejail int he parrotsec docs.
# https://parrotsec.org/docs/configuration/apparmor/

# Apparmor has been included in Ubuntu as of Ubuntu 20.04 but is not enabled and for additional profiles more work is needed.

# To install do a full install of Apparmor
sudo apt install apparmor-utils apparmor-notify apparmor-profiles apparmor-profiles-extra

sudo systemctl status apparmor

sudo systemctl enable apparmor

#Firejail is comparatively easy.
sudo apt install firejail
sudo firecfg
