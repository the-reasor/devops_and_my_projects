#Here I will explain how to install and configure firejail and apparmor on a fresh install of Ubuntu.
#Doing this will result in a fairly secure system and this is what is implemented in professional tools like Parrot Security OS.
# I dont think there is a entry on firejail int he parrotsec docs.
# https://parrotsec.org/docs/configuration/apparmor/

sudo apt install firejail
sudo firecfg
