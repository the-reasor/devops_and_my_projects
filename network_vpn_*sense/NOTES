# In Wireguard the /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf file has a section called "AllowedIPs".
# In this config file the option to set the netmask is available, however, by default it is set to /32.
# In the *sense firewall handbooks it states:
# "Do not use a tunnel address that is a /32 (IPv4) or a /128 (IPv6)"
# This post details the reasons behind that and what can be done about it.
