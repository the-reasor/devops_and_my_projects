# By default the sources.list and gpg keys are incorrect for unpaid versions and must be fixed.

# This guide provides information about correcting this issue for Proxmox version 8 and up.
# This version is current as up the time of me writing this.

# Should the version of the base system (debian) change please follow the details provided here to accomodate those changes.

# This guide assumes you know how to use terminal text editors such as "nano" or "vim".


# Find the version of debian the system is based on:
cat /etc/os-release

# It should look like:
#  PRETTY_NAME="Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)"  <<<<<
#  NAME="Debian GNU/Linux"
#  VERSION_ID="12"
#  VERSION="12 (bookworm)" <<<<<
#  VERSION_CODENAME=bookworm <<<<<
#  ID=debian
#  HOME_URL="https://www.debian.org/"
#  SUPPORT_URL="https://www.debian.org/support"
#  BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.debian.org/

# I have noted the lines containing the debian version name by appending "<<<<<" after them.
# Please take note of this it will be needed later several times.

# Now we need to edit the files inside the "/etc/apt/sources.list.d/" direcory.

cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
ls

# The files should be: ceph.list  pve-enterprise.list  pve-install-repo.list  pve-no-subscription.list
# The only files that should contain an actionable list (not commented out) are "ceph.list" and "pve-install-repo.list".


# Replace the text inside ceph.list with the following:
deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/ceph-quincy bookworm no-subscription


# Replace the text inside pve-install-repo.list with the following:
deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve bookworm pve-no-subscription



# Rewrite the following lines to reflect whatever version name your version is. For instance:
# https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/proxmox-release-(version name)

# Now for proxmox version 8.x use these commands
rm -r /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/proxmox-release-bullseye.gpg
wget http://download.proxmox.com/debian/proxmox-release-bookworm.gpg -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/proxmox-release-bookworm.gpg


# Now comment out the lines in each of the other files by adding a "#" before each.
# These are the files: pve-enterprise.list    pve-no-subscription.list

# Now update the system:
apt update

# You may still get warnings but it should not prevent it from updating.

# Now upgrade outdated packages

apt upgrade -y
