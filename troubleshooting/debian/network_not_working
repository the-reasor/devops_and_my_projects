#Sometimes debian will fail to configure the network durring an install from the network installer image, and maybe others.
#Here are some common things to check and fix.

cd /etc/systemd/network
ls

# In a healthy install this should list a few files, each named after an network interface on your computer, usually something like:
# 10-lan.network (or something similar)

# If no files exist in that directory you can create a basic network configuration for LAN by making a file named 10-lan.network and entering this config.

nano /etc/systemd/network/10-lan.network
#enter the following

[Match]
Name=eno1 #Put your interface here

[Network]
DHCP=ipv4
MulticastDNS=yes

#press ctrl+s then ctrl+x
#now reboot
sudo shutdown -r now
