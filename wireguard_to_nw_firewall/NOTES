# In Wireguard the /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf file has a section called "AllowedIPs".
# In this config file the option to set the netmask is available, however, by default it is set to /32.
# In the *sense firewall handbooks it states:
# "Do not use a tunnel address that is a /32 (IPv4) or a /128 (IPv6)"
# This post details the reasons behind that and what can be done about it.

# Unfortunately this person seems to be bodging things, OCI instances dont actually use UFW, and instead use raw iptables.
# I learned that the hard way after some issues with ssh not connecting and LOTS of research. Dont use UFW on OCI instances!
# He also allows everything through OCI's firewall and that bugs the heck out of me so freaking much.
# I would prefer to leverage the INDUSTRY GRADE firewall that they have freely available to me but hey, maybe its just me.

# Unfortunately OCI likes to rearange their entire layout and recategorize things without updating their documentation.
# ..Or leave about five different locations of (maybe) outdated documentations and about a dozen other things that at first appear related but in fact have no relation.
# My point is terraform doesnt work with OCI anymore. I dont think they even provide some of the keys needed anymore.
# I tried everything even using the OCI terminal they provide. It was too much hastle to get terraform working again.
# Dont bother with the automated install linked in the above github, that is the one that uses Terraform. Much easier to just ssh and do it by hand.
# I forked this guide to my github for convenience.
